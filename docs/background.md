Everyday children are reported missing. Some are runaways but many have been 
kidnapped and are in great danger. The following are the number of cases reported for 2014-2016 

1. 2014: 445,045
2. 2015: 460,699 
3. 2016: 465,676 

The questions that I hope to discover answers to are patterns such as does one state have more kidnappings than another? Is there something visually that can explain any peaks and valleys? Does gender have anything to do with the numbers, meaning is there a spike between boys and girls or are both being kidnapped/ missing at an equal rate? Do the seasons come into play with abductions?  Are more children kidnapped during the summer than the winter or vice versa? There is not an argument other than it only takes a minute window for a child to be abducted and with the numbers increasing yearly by 15,000 children it seems that times are becoming more dangerous for children and predators are growing in numbers.

## Historical/Digital Background

The data I am using has several categories to classify the missing child. Lost Injured Missing, Non-Family Abduction, Endangered Runaway and section 5779 which for some states while the child is 18 they are still younger than 21 and considered juvenile. 
Years ago the popularity of milk was capitalized on and milk cartons became billboards for the faces of the missing. https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/02/when-bad-news-was-printed-on-milk-cartons/516675/. This article written by the atlantic.com discusses the evolution of the missing children reporting system This method is no longer used. Now there is social media and the amber alert system as well as the news. The Amber Alert system has a broadcast method and a mobile method. The broadcast method involves the news running a segment about the child, the abductor and last known information. The Mobile aspect sounds off an alarm on cellular devices with brief textualized info as well has info on the interstate system on digital displays. Example: “child missing, White Honda civic, license plate 123ABC, last seen wearing etc. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also plays a key role in maintaining the database of missing children and maintains a master list. Much of the work that goes into the search for missing children stems from the murder of Adam Walsh, the son of John Walsh, the host of America’s Most Wanted. Adam was declared dead on July 27th, 1981 after being missing/kidnapped.  In 1984, the U>S Congress passed the Missing Children’s Assistance Act, partly after the advocacy of the Walsh family and other parents with missing children.  After this Act, The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children was formed. (NCMEC)
