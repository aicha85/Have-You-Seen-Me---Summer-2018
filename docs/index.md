My project is a visualization of children reported missing in the United Stated over the past four years of 2014 to 2017. 
When I submitted my proposal and bibliography I focused on the date of 1984 to 2017. Now that I am sitting down to write this final version, I think it is better to focus on just the past 4 years for a narrower analysis.
