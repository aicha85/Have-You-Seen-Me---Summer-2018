# Initial Findings

I decided to analyze missing children for 2014 to 2017  because this is a type of war on children. This is a history course but, this is a current issue that is increasing yearly. This country has a current history with children dropping off the grid. I also realized that my proposal is a guide that I can use to complete this final portion.  I also wonder if we as a society are passing by these missing children everyday and have no idea because we aren’t paying attention. What would I even do if I thought I saw a child from a poster? Would it even register? I decided to research top data visualization tools. I came across a tool on www.reports.zoho.com and it served as a game changer for me. I was able to see multiple angles to present this information and it provided a user-friendly step by step process. I was even able to use darker visualizations which is one of my favorite ways to present data. 
The first thing I realized is that this tool grabs onto what it wants, and it created charts using the child’s id number which does not tell me anything. I tried to remove that column but was not allowed to. This caused me to go back to my original data and remove that and any other columns and then resubmit the csv file to create new reports. After reuploaded the CSV file, I learned that I could simply remove the columns I did not want prior to generating the report. 
For some reason this tool grabbed on to the height of the child and I had to figure out how to remove that entirely and cause it to use the missing date instead.

## Age of Missing
The Reports generated a birthdate analysis instantly showing that more female children are missing than male. The mode age of most missing was around 16 to 17. The top three birth years of the missing where 1999, 2000 and 2001. 
Another chart showed that for these target years of 2014 to 2017 65% were female and 35% were male.
I learned from looking at the graphs that there were six children missing from Mexico, six missing from Canada and one from the Philippines as well. I did not realize that just from looking at the excel data. I am not certain if they were dual citizens or if it was a custody battle.

## Gender vs Year:
Breaking down the data by gender vs year I saw that in 2014 43% of the missing were female 57% were male. For this year more, male children were missing. As well as the next year where it was 29% female and 71% male. In 2016 there was a shift and 67 % were female and 33 % male.

## Case classification:
Half way through I noticed that I was interpreting the data incorrectly because it the charts are color coded and showing me a higher rate of males than females. 
The categories show that more males are in the Endangered Runaway category than females honestly males lead in four of the five categories of Family Abduction, Lost Injured missing and Section 5799 which is 18 but under 21.

## Classification by Race and Gender per year:
I was not able to use my Zoho reports to interpret this. I tried several attempts 
So, I used Tableau. Seems like different tools are better for different questions. 
The data shows trends between male and females for 2014 through 2017. 
## 2017:
In 2017 There were 111 Black females missing vs 48 Black males. 138 White females vs 66 White males. 72 female Hispanics and 34Hispanic males. 
Zero Pacific Islanders Male or Female, 45 Biracial Females and 26 Biracial Males, 1 Asian Male and Zero Asian Females, 3 American Indian Females and 1 American Indian Male. 
# 2016:
There were 169 Black females missing vs 42 Black males. 170 White females vs 100 White males. 189 female Hispanics and 110 Hispanic males. 
1 Pacific Islanders Female & Zero PI males, 65 Biracial Females and 25 Biracial Males, 1 Asian Males and 5 Asian Females, 7 American Indian Females and 8 American Indian Male. 
# 2015:
There were 12 Black females missing vs 8 Black males. 16 White females vs 16 White males. 51 female Hispanics and 24 Hispanic males. 
1 Pacific Islanders Female, 14 Biracial Females and 5 Biracial Males, 1 Asian Male and 2 Asian Females, 1 American Indian Females and 2 American Indian Males. 
# 2014:
There were7 Black females missing vs 4 Black males. 8 White females vs 6 White males. 17 female Hispanics and 5 Hispanic males. 
Zero Pacific Islanders Male or Female, 4 Biracial Females and 4 Biracial Males, 1 Asian Male and Zero Asian Females, 0 American Indians and 0 Asians

## Map of City, Country, and Gender
I wanted to create a map to show the location that the missing children originated from. At first, I was not able to do this and could not understand why. Then I noticed that in Tableau the city and states were classified as ABC and I figured out that I needed to reclassify them as geo. I was able to create a map in a four-panel screen than shows each year side by side color coded to show females vs males.

## After this Project:

The only logical step I can think of to continue this project is to discover whether or not any of these missing children were ever found dead or alive. Right now the mystery is that they are missing; but, the next question is yes, what happened to them?
I do not know if that is a question that can even been answered. Whenever a child is found they cancel an amber alert but there are many times where it just remains a mystery.
