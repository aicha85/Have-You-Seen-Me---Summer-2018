# Problems and Possibilities

One problem with this project is that there are 50 states with different databases and that the FBI has a database but there is not a real way to know if all the children listed on the FBI database are being included on the state that the child went missing from. Another issue is that there is not a found database. I am not certain whether if the child is found if they are removed from the database of the over 450K that are missing each year I did not come across how many are found. Found also does not mean alive. I saw many closed cases, but they don’t indicate if the child is living. Since the missing population is so large it would take an enormous amount of time to scrape over 450K cases into a csv file. The file would also grow probably every hour. Even for my sample size of around 2300 when I attempted to make a map in Tableau I received an error message

	“There is not enough memory to display the 1240 rows and 842 columns in this view. To enable the view, remove fields from the Rows and Columns or filter the data.

	After I removed data as instructed then I was told the online Map could not be constructed. 

Other issues I ran into began during the visualization process. I spoke about this in initial findings. There were certain limitations to the tool I used and I had to adapt to display the questions I needed to answer.
