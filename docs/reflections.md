# Problems and Possibilities

This section serves as your sort-of conclusion/summary. Not a summary of the historical subject, but a summary of the process of the project itself. By discussing where you hit roadblocks and where you wish you could go if you had more time, you leave future individuals something to build on.

You should talk about where you group encountered the most difficulties. What was the hardest about scraping, or visualizing, or locating historiography? Did you have problems communicating or sharing files on GitHub?

What problems stopped you dead in the water? Did you have to change course mid-project to account for data that you could not get, or was not what you thought?

Moving on from problems, let's the reader on a positive note. What worked best, where did you think the strength of the project was? What were the most useful historical insights? What were the most useful tools?

Finally, think of future attempts to continue this line of research, whether by yourself or others. Where do you want to go with it. What areas do you think could be expanded easily? You can discuss what you wish you could have done but could not due to lack of time/skill/et.c. But, much more than that, what would you suggest would be the most useful thing(s) you think could actually be accomplished in the space of another semester?

One problem with this project is that there are 50 states with different databases and that the FBI has a database but there is not a real way to know if all the children listed on the FBI database are being included on the state that the child went missing from. Another issue is that there is not a found database. I am not certain whether if the child is found if they are removed from the database of the over 450K that are missing each year I did not come across how many are found. Found also does not mean alive. I saw many closed cases, but they don’t indicate if the child is living. Since the missing population is so large it would take an enormous amount of time to scrape over 450K cases into a csv file. The file would also grow probably every hour. Even for my sample size of around 2300 when I attempted to make a map in Tableau I received an error message

	“There is not enough memory to display the 1240 rows and 842 columns in this view. To enable the view, remove fields from the Rows and Columns or filter the data.

	After I removed data as instructed then I was told the online Map could not be constructed.
