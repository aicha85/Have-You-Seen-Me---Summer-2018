# Source Analysis
My data source is a csv file from https://data.world/jamesgray/missing-children-in-the-us/workspace/file?filename=MediaReadyActiveCases+with+cleaned+height+value.csv. It is a csv file that was created March 27, 2018 by a user named James Gray. The file lists reported missing children from 1955 to 2017. The data included the child id number, first name, last name, birthdate, sex, race, hair color, eye color, height, weight, missing reported date, missing from date, missing from city, missing from state, missing from country, the case type, poster contact and URL to the poster. What I noticed was that the data for the missing from column starts back in 1955. The reported missing data only goes back to 1984. I also noticed a difference in the date the child was missing and the data it was reported.  Example: Aaron Anderson was missing from 4/7/1989 but it was not reported until 5/23/1989. The data is not clear on that gap of time in reporting. This record only contains 2593 cases. There are more children missing than that. 
Another thing I noticed is that there are many different databases. Some claim to be a master list but that’s not possible. Each state has its own database and the FBI has a master list. https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/about-us/cjis/ncic/ncic-missing-person-and-unidentified-person-statistics-for-2014

## Authorship

According to Data World and the publisher of the CSV James Gray, the data was scraped from The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. It also provides a link to the missing child’s poster for visual connection with the data. The information is public and this data set was used in a crowdfunded digital project called Cloudera Child Finder. It was data used as part of a Hackathon between Cloudera and Intel at the Southwest Music Festival (SXSW) to develop new digital methods to locate missing children.

## Data Analysis

* Do the datasets involved reflect the viewpoints of particular groups or institutions, and if so, who?
* What kinds of categorizations do you find in the data, and do they seem reasonable?
* Do the means of data collection or categorization affect how the data is constructed in any way?
* Does the website contain any tools for visualizing the data? Do they seem like they are making any kind of arguments?
