# Workflow

Describe your overall workflow here.

Discuss (in detail) the processes of

* I obtained the data from this project after searching for information regarding Missing Children. 
* In terms of cleaning the data, the only thing I did was focus on a certain time frame.
* Data World has an option to visualize the data built into the open forum. I used their visualization tool.


What you need to cover: Talk about every step in your process, talk about how and why you made the decisions that you did. Why did you pick the website that you did?
I chose this website because it contained a csv file that was highly organized and useful. The website allows others to analyze the data and why they used the data to attempt to create new digital ways to track missing children. I am using it to find out what is there.

During the beginning of this assignment I was not confident regarding what I should be doing. I was interested in several topics. I only decided on this topic recently. Due to my indecisive nature, I did not elect to sign up for a group as I did not want to be locked into working on a project topic or responsible to others. I was confused much of the time until a few days ago after submitting the proposal and bibliography, which is when things began to make more sense. 
While working on the final portions of this project, I found it easier to take a more traditional approach.  First, I typed up an outline in Microsoft Word of all the portions from the final project repository. Doing this took some of the stress out of completing this assignment because I was able to focus and created order for myself. I was thinking of it as a digital project but that was too much stress because I could not focus on the writing which is usually the easiest portion for me.  After completing every portion in Word I will be able to relax because all I have to do now is transfer this information into the markup template as opposed to doing section by section while in the repository having not written anything, which will permit me to complete this ahead of schedule.
